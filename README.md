# ColorWise-Diagnostics

App Description:
My app is a color blindness testing tool that uses Ishihara plates to assess users' color vision.  It features two categories: Red-Green and Special. Users start with six standard plates, and if they answer incorrectly, that category is flagged. After completing the initial six, they'll receive additional plates from the flagged category. If the flagged category is Special, users will see a decider plate to determine if they have protanopia (red blindness) and protanomaly (red deficiency), deuteranopia (green blindness) and deuteranomaly (green deficiency), or all four. Based on the results, they’ll be shown specific plates related to their condition for further testing. At the end, a specialized results page appears, tailored to the user's testing answers. This page summarizes their correct and incorrect responses for each category and confirms whether they have any type of color blindness. Additionally, there's an "I Don’t Know" checkbox for those who can’t see the numbers, which counts as an incorrect answer.
